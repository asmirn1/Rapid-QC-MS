Installing MS-AutoQC is relatively easy and straightforward. You'll need to:

3. Download MS-DIAL
4. Download and install Docker
5. Install MSConvert

If you run into trouble or have any questions, please feel free to [open a new issue on GitHub](https://github.com/czbiohub/MS-AutoQC/issues), or send an email to wasim.sandhu@czbiohub.org. You can also visit the [Troubleshooting](https://github.com/czbiohub/MS-AutoQC/wiki/Troubleshooting) section to see if your issue has been documented already.

# Important note
While, to our knowledge, installation of the following software packages on data acquisition computers comes _at no risk_, it is possible for a wary user to install MS-AutoQC on a separate computer.

Because MS-AutoQC only needs access to the data acquisition path (i.e. the folder where your MS data is being collected), you can install all of the packages on a different computer. The only requirement is that **the instrument computer must be mounted as a network drive on the MS-AutoQC installation computer.** 

If you don't have any experience with mapping a network drive in Windows, consult your IT department or check out [this tutorial on Microsoft Support](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/map-a-network-drive-in-windows-29ce55d1-34e3-a7e2-4801-131475f9557d#ID0EBD=Windows_10).

We have not tested this functionality ourselves. If you plan to test this out, please come back and let us know how it goes!

# 1. Install Python
If you don't have Python installed already, please [download and install the latest release of Python 3](https://www.python.org/downloads/) for Windows or Mac (which is v3.11 at the time of this writing).

# 2. Download and install MS-AutoQC
## a. Download MS-AutoQC
Please [download the latest version of MS-AutoQC](https://github.com/czbiohub/MS-AutoQC/releases) (which is v1.0 at the time of this writing) for either Windows or MacOS.

Once the ZIP file has been downloaded and extracted, MS-AutoQC can be launched from a Command Prompt or Terminal window. For example, if the MS-AutoQC folder path was `C:/Users/Wasim/Downloads/MS-AutoQC`, the user should enter the following commands:

```console
cd C:/Users/Wasim/Downloads/MS-AutoQC
python MS-AutoQC.py
```

Alternatively, Windows users can also launch MS-AutoQC by double-clicking the .exe file.

## b. Install Python dependencies
On first launch, Python will install all required dependencies automatically, and this may take a minute or two. (If you're curious, you can find a list of these dependencies [here](https://github.com/czbiohub/MS-AutoQC/blob/main/requirements.txt).)

Once that's done, MS-AutoQC will open in your web browser and should look like this:

If you see this screen, then MS-AutoQC was installed properly! If not, double check your command prompt and see if there were any errors in package installation. You can refer to the [Troubleshooting](https://github.com/czbiohub/MS-AutoQC/wiki/Troubleshooting) page for common mistakes / errors.

## Important note
At this point, if you are installing MS-AutoQC only to sign in to your workspace and view the QC dashboard, you can move on to the [Getting Started](https://github.com/czbiohub/MS-AutoQC/wiki/Getting-Started) section and learn how to use MS-AutoQC.

If you are installing MS-AutoQC on an instrument computer, follow through with installation of MS-DIAL and MSConvert below.

# 3. Download MS-DIAL
Please [download the latest version of MS-DIAL 4](http://prime.psc.riken.jp/compms/msdial/download/repository/) (which is v4.9.2 at the time of this writing). If the provided link doesn't work, you can visit [the MS-DIAL website](http://prime.psc.riken.jp/compms/msdial/main.html) to find it. 

Once the download has completed, extract the ZIP file into a directory of your choice.

# 4. Download and install Docker
Docker is required to install the MSConvert Docker image, which allows MS-AutoQC to run it from the command-line.

Please [download and install Docker for Windows](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/windows-install/).

# 5. Install MSConvert
Once Docker is installed, open a new instance of Command Prompt and enter the following to install the MSConvert Docker image:

```console
docker pull chambm/pwiz-skyline-i-agree-to-the-vendor-licenses
```

# 6. Celebrate!
If you've reached this point, you're one giant step closer to using MS-AutoQC for your LC-MS instrument runs!

When you're ready, please visit the [Getting Started](https://github.com/czbiohub/MS-AutoQC/wiki/Getting-Started) section to learn how to configure and use your MS-AutoQC workspace.
