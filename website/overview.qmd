Many different things can go wrong during an LC-MS instrument run, leading to unusable data. That's why it is crucial to stop a run and troubleshoot if something is wrong.

Many metabolomics labs have various quality control measures in place for every sample preparation protocol, such as internal standards or biological "benchmark" standards. However, analyzing the data from these QC markers can be tedious and time-consuming.

This section describes the various features of MS-AutoQC, and how they can help inform on the quality of your untargeted metabolomics data in a time-efficient manner.

# Interactive dashboard
## Retention time across samples
Plotting retention time values for a given internal standard gives insight into **retention time shifts**, which can indicate any of the following:

* Incorrect mobile phase concentration
* Changes in flow rate
* Changes in column temperature
* Faulty column

With MS-AutoQC, you can view an RT vs. sample plot for each of your internal standards. Select an internal standard using the **dropdown**, or seek through them using the **previous / next buttons.**

## Intensity across samples
Plotting intensity (peak height) values can give insight into **sample preparation** and **ionization variability**. Low internal standard intensities can indicate the following:

* Bad injection
* Error in sample preparation
* Instrument performance (sample not ionizing correctly)

MS-AutoQC allows you to filter the intensity vs. sample plot by samples, pools, or blanks using the **plot filter** on the left-hand side. You can scroll through the plot using the **plot scroll bar** below.

## Delta m/z vs. sample plot
Plotting delta m/z values can give insight into **mass accuracy** and **instrument performance.**

## Sample information card
To investigate a sample more closely, you can select one from the **sample table** (or click a marker on the plot!) and the **sample information card** will open.

This card conveniently aggregates information from the sequence, metadata, processed data, and QC results into one place.

## New job setup
Setting up a **new MS-AutoQC job** was designed to be as fast and easy as possible. To get the AutoQC algorithm running, the user just needs to enter:

* Run ID
* Chromatography
* Biological standards _(optional)_
* Acquisition sequence file
* Sample metadata file
* Data file directory

The form will then give the user intelligent feedback on whether they have provided valid resources. Once the user has chosen whether the job is for an **active** or **completed** instrument run, the new job can be executed.

# Highly configurable settings
MS-AutoQC was designed to be highly configurable for many use cases. As such, the user has complete authority on configuring workspace access, chromatography methods, biological standards, AutoQC parameters, and MS-DIAL processing parameters.

If you've already [installed MS-AutoQC and its dependencies](https://github.com/czbiohub/MS-AutoQC/wiki/Installation), you can check out the [Getting Started](https://github.com/czbiohub/MS-AutoQC/wiki/Getting-Started) section to learn how to maximize your MS-AutoQC deployment.
