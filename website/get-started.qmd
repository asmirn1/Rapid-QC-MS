In this section, you can learn how to set up and configure MS-AutoQC for your mass spectrometry instrument.

# Important note
**This section does NOT show you how to install MS-AutoQC!**

If you haven't already, please follow the steps in the [installation guide](https://github.com/czbiohub/MS-AutoQC/wiki/Installation) before you start configuring methods and parameters.

# New instrument setup
If you are setting up MS-AutoQC for the first time – or setting up MS-AutoQC on a new LC-MS instrument PC – please follow the steps in this section to properly configure your chromatography methods and AutoQC parameters.

The first few steps will walk you through configuring the bare necessities to setup MS-AutoQC jobs for your instrument runs.

The last few steps will cover additional advanced settings such as Google Drive sync, Slack/email notifications, biological standards, and MS-DIAL processing parameters.

10. [_Optional: Configure Slack/email notifications_](#10-optional-configure-slackemail-notifications)

## 1. Start MS-AutoQC
You can start MS-AutoQC using Python. For example, if the MS-AutoQC folder path was `C:/Users/Wasim/Downloads/MS-AutoQC`, the user should enter the following commands in Command Prompt:

```python
cd C:/Users/Wasim/Downloads/MS-AutoQC
python MS-AutoQC.py
```

## 2. Create a new workspace
If you followed the steps in the [installation guide](https://github.com/czbiohub/MS-AutoQC/wiki/Installation) correctly, you will be greeted by the following welcome screen:

![Welcome screen](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7220175/201739007-859db808-0d4b-4f94-85f1-f7deaf632e1c.png)

Please select **I'm setting up MS-AutoQC on a new instrument.** Then, you will be prompted to give your instrument a unique name and select your instrument's vendor.

![I'm setting up MS-AutoQC on a new instrument](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7220175/201740090-7b2c00f4-cec4-4f59-9f7a-da48d88b1344.png)

### Optional: Sync with Google Drive
TBD

Once you're done, click **Complete setup** to create your workspace. After your workspace loads, it should look something like this:

![Blank workspace](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7220175/201771245-963d25d3-4d28-43ca-9276-9e9992372066.png)

## 3. Configure internal standards
Now that the workspace has been created, you're ready to start configuring your chromatography methods and corresponding internal standards. The workflow for adding internal standards is simple:

a. Add a chromatography method
b. Select the chromatography and polarity to modify
c. Add an internal standard library
d. _Optional: Set a different MS-DIAL processing configuration_

### 3a. Add a chromatography method

Navigate to **Settings (in the top right corner) > Internal Standards.** Once you're there, it should look something like this:

![Settings > Internal Standards](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7220175/201776872-a2ea8bf7-fac9-453a-a7a2-f0dcf2596e5a.png)

In the **Manage chromatography methods** section at the top, add a new chromatography method by giving it a name and clicking **Add method**.

![Add a new chromatography method](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7220175/201778888-2d17d60c-618e-4182-a96a-9eb13d231326.png)

If successful, you should see your new method in the **Chromatography methods** table.

### 3b. Select the chromatography and polarity to modify
Internal standards must be configured for both positive and negative mode for each chromatography method.

Let's start by selecting the chromatography method you created, and then selecting **Positive Mode** for the polarity.

![Configure chromatography methods](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7220175/201782171-c7090fa6-3123-4a7c-adee-0252ce1a3c99.png)

### 3c. Add an internal standard library
Now, we can specify our internal standard library. MS-AutoQC accepts identification libraries in either MSP or CSV format (although it is important to note that MS-DIAL cannot perform MS2 spectral matching using CSV libraries during identification).

Here is an example internal standard library in CSV format:

| Common Name                  | MS1 m/z     | RT (min) |
| ---------------------------- | ----------- | -------- |
| 1\_Methionine\_d8            | 158.1085398 | 7.479    |
| 1\_1\_Methylnicotinamide\_d3 | 141.0975946 | 6.217    |
| 1\_Creatinine\_d3            | 117.0850186 | 4.908    |
| 1\_Carnitine\_d3             | 165.1313    | 7.8      |
| 1\_Acetylcarnitine\_d3       | 207.1418647 | 7.169    |
| 1\_TMAO\_d9                  | 85.13218108 | 5.495    |
| 1\_Choline\_d9               | 114.1713062 | 5.123    |
| 1\_CUDA                      | 341.2798695 | 1.104    |
| 1\_Glutamine\_d5             | 152.1078024 | 8.642    |
| 1\_Glutamic Acid\_d3         | 151.0792645 | 8.805    |
| 1\_Arginine\_d7              | 182.1628894 | 9.497    |
| 1\_Alanine\_d3               | 93.07378516 | 8.14     |
| 1\_Valine d8                 | 126.136469  | 7.809    |
| 1\_Tryptophan d5             | 210.1285378 | 6.897    |
| 1\_Serine d3                 | 109.0686998 | 8.704    |
| 1\_Lysine d8                 | 155.1630181 | 9.578    |
| 1\_Phenylalanine d8          | 174.136469  | 6.92     |
| 1\_Hippuric acid d5          | 185.0969033 | 3.011    |

And here is one internal standard from a library in MSP format:

```
NAME: 1_HippuricAcid_d5
SCANNUMBER: 1229
RETENTIONTIME: 3.011485
PRECURSORMZ: 185.0967
PRECURSORTYPE: [M+H]+
IONMODE: Positive
INTENSITY: 2.157809E+07
ISOTOPE: M + 0
INCHIKEY:
SMILES:
FORMULA:
Num Peaks: 33
51.02318	5550
56.94302	2599
57.93503	32786
...
171.3111	3202
181.08981	2837
185.09656	4996
```

Click the **Browse Files** button to browse for your MSP or CSV file, then click the **Add MSP to <Chromatography> Positive Mode** button.

![Add internal standard identification files](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7220175/201782255-797d9dcf-23fe-45c1-a9ab-bdd090387494.png)

That's it! Now, you can select Negative Mode from the polarity dropdown and add your negative mode internal standards. Once you're done, your screen should look something like this:

![Internal standard settings configured](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7220175/201782345-11c3608d-ce21-4461-971b-0f082b41676a.png)

## 4. Configure AutoQC parameters
Once you have configured your chromatography methods, you can then navigate to **Settings > QC Configurations** to define your QC criteria.

![Settings > QC configurations](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7220175/201806318-e2ca414a-9940-421c-803c-d7112c1fb1d4.png)

MS-AutoQC stores individual parameters in configurations, so that you can configure a specific configuration to fit each chromatography method.

![Settings > QC configurations](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7220175/201807660-b260a6db-5b01-4f78-80fb-7c7710e987b5.png)

You can specify these parameters however you'd like, and enable / disable them as needed. To revert a configuration back to the default recommended settings, simply click the **Reset default settings** button.

Once you're done, don't forget to click **Save changes**!

## 5. Specify MS-DIAL location
The last thing to do is to specify the location of your MS-DIAL v4 download.

To do this, navigate to **Settings > MS-DIAL Configurations** and browse (or enter) the folder path into the **MS-DIAL download location** field.

For example, if the downloaded MS-DIAL files are located in `C:\Users\eliaslab\Documents\MSDIAL`, then enter this into the text field and click **Save Changes**.

![Settings > MS-DIAL Configurations](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7220175/201808621-84f8ae3c-3aa8-4619-b1b5-54826c64a918.png)

## 6. Setup a new run
Setting up a new MS-AutoQC job was designed to be as fast and easy as possible. To get MS-AutoQC monitoring an active instrument run (or QC'ing a completed batch), the user simply needs to enter a few fields of information:

1. Run ID
2. Chromatography method
3. _Optional: Biological standard(s)_
4. Acquisition sequence file
5. _Optional: sample metadata_
6. Data acquisition path

![New MS-AutoQC Job](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7220175/201810821-5c17d974-6e58-4e34-97cd-473dd6890fb5.png)

MS-AutoQC will intelligently validate that everything is in place for it to start working. It does this by:

1. Ensuring that the run ID is unique so that data is not corrupted
2. Verifying that your chromatography method has valid internal standard libraries
3. Ensuring that your acquisition sequence contains the required columns
4. Verifying that the data acquisition path exists
5. Validating biological standard libraries and sample metadata columns

Once it has validated these fields, the blue button will become enabled and you're all set to begin.
